## JavaScript Koans: More concepts in JavaScript

In this set of examples and tests we cover advanced JavaScript concepts such as 
 - closure,
 - inheritance
 - variable hoisting
 - 'this' with context switch...

### Quick start
**Make sure you have Node version >= 6.0 and NPM >= 3**

> Clone/Download the repo then edit `*.spec.js` files inside [`/test/`](/test/)

> Replace all `__` to fix failing tests

```bash
# clone our repo
git clone https://github.com/hackages/advanced.js.koans

# change directory to our repo
cd advanced.js.koans

# start the server (`npm install` will be performed for you)
npm start

# start your tests in the console (`npm install` will be performed for you)
npm test

```
go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser

**We use Mocha in this repository**

**For those using `yarn`, make sure to remove the `prestart` script before running `yarn**

**For those using **WallabyJS**, just run it and you'll be on your way to master JS syntax**
